We also believe in compatibility with existing infrastructure and applications (both open source and proprietary). Thus our solutions are cross-platform: including Linux and Mac OS X on the server-side; Windows, Linux and Mac on the desktop; and Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer browsers.Key customers we work with include service providers, higher education institutions, and Fortune 1000 enterprises, particularly in the financial services, retail, and manufacturing sectors.We are based in San Mateo, California, and are backed by venture capital firms Benchmark Partners and Redpoint Ventures, both of Menlo Park, CA, and Accel Capital of Palo Alto, CA.
