The Third Battle of Kharkov was a series of offensive operations undertaken=
 by the German Army Group South against the Red Army around the city of Kha=
rkov in 1943. As the German Sixth Army was encircled in Stalingrad, the Red=
 Army undertook a series of wider offensives against the rest of Army Group=
 South. These culminated on 2 January 1943, when the Soviets launched Opera=
tion Star, which between January and early February broke German defenses a=
nd led to the Soviet recapture of Kharkov, Belgorod and Kursk. Despite the =
success of the Soviet offensive, it also resulted in participating Soviet u=
nits over-extending themselves. Freed on 2 February by the surrender of the=
 German Sixth Army, the Red Army's Central Front turned its attention west =
and on 25 February expanded its offensive against both Army Group South and=
 Army Group Center. However, months of continuous operations had taken a he=
avy toll on the Soviets and some divisions were reduced to 1,000=E2=80=931,=
500 combat effectives. On 19 February, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein too=
k the opportunity to launch his counterstroke, using the fresh SS Panzer Co=
rps and two panzer armies. Although the Germans were also understrength, th=
e Wehrmacht successfully flanked, encircled and defeated the Red Army's arm=
ored spearheads south of Kharkov.
