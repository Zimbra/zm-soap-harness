I only have 4 point to make in this discussion.

Yes.  If they would support LDAP V3 we wouldn't be having these
discussions.  Maybe Melissa, Chris and/or I can put pressure on
Keder that this is an important issue not only for Ucla but for
other companies as well.  But this isn't going to help us in the
short term.  Thus, we need to use one of the three or so "solutions"
that I've heard discussed so far and will leave it to those who have
a stake in the outcome to decide.
