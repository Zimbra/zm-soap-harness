Did the JDK make the map operations safe in the face of multiple threads do=
ing operations which modify the map?   I believe that users should expect r=
ead oriented operations to be thread safe and write operations to be unsafe=
 (uses will need to synchronize in order to make them safe).

The problem I'm facing with the architecture of the store is one where it s=
eems that I have to trade off synchronize/finalize with object creation.  I=
've found that creating fewer objects benefits performance, but renders rea=
d operations thread unsafe.

Dave and I talked this morning about this and we believe that performance o=
f the store is so important that making the store thread safe (for read ope=
rations) will be optional and *off* by default. =20

Any thoughts?  Any confusion about this trade off? =20

I think you should be careful not to make the same mistakes that the JDK
made early on with the map implementations.  The early map implementations
were thread safe and very slow, so no-one used them.  It might be best to
have two implementations of the store (one that is thread safe & one that
isn't) so that users can choose safety over performance.  Or performance if
they know the data will only be read in a single thread as may be the case
in WS-invocations...
