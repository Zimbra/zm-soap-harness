How do I use advanced search?

return to Help Center

Advanced search operators are query words or symbols that perform
special actions in Gmail search. These operators allow you to find
what you're looking for quickly and accurately. Some of the most
useful operators are listed below. You can also use advanced search
operators by clicking on 'Show search options' beneath the Gmail
search box.

from:
     Used to specify the sender.
     Example. from:amy
     Meaning. Messages from Amy.
to:
     Used to specify a recipient.
     Example. to:david
     Meaning. Messages that were sent to David (not necessarily by you).
subject:
     Used to search for words in the subject line.
     Example. subject:dinner
     Meaning. Messages that contain the word dinner in the subject.
OR
     The operator OR (must be in all caps) is used to search for
messages matching either of two different sets of criteria.
     Example. from:amy OR from:david
     Meaning. Messages from Amy or from David.

     Also note that the =7C pipe operator has the same function as 'OR.'
     Example. from:(amy=7Cdavid)
     Meaning. Messages from Amy or from David
-
     The minus sign (hyphen) is used to exclude messages from your search.
     Example. dinner -movie
     Meaning. Messages that contain the word dinner but do not contain
the word movie.
label:
     Used to search for messages with the specified label.
     Example. from:amy label:fun-stuff
     Meaning. Messages from Amy to which you've applied the label =
=22fun-stuff=22.

     At this time, it is not possible to search for all unlabeled messages.
has:attachment
     Used to search for messages with an attached file.
     Example. from:david has:attachment
     Meaning. Messages from David that contain an attached file.
filename:
     Used to search for words in attachment file names.
     Example. filename:myfile.txt
     Meaning. Messages with an attachment named =22myfile.txt=22.
     Example. label:work filename:pdf
     Meaning. Messages with the label =22work=22 that have a PDF-type =
attachment.
=22 =22
     Quotes are used to search for an exact phrase.
     Example. =22i'm feeling lucky=22
     Meaning. Messages containing the phrase =22i'm feeling lucky=22
(capitalization doesn't matter).
     Example. subject:=22dinner and a movie=22
     Meaning. Messages containing the phrase =22dinner and a movie=22 in
the subject.
( )
     Parentheses are used for logical grouping.
     Example. from:amy (dinner OR movie)
     Meaning. Messages from Amy that contain either the word dinner or
the word movie.
     Example. subject:(dinner movie)
     Meaning. Messages in which the subject contains both the word
dinner and the word movie.
in:anywhere
     Used to search for messages anywhere in an account (including
messages marked spam and messages in the Trash, which are normally
excluded from searches).
in:inbox
in:trash
in:spam
     Used to search for messages in the Inbox, in the Trash, or marked
spam. is:starred
is:unread
is:read
     Used to search for messages that are marked with a star, have not
been read, or have been read. cc:
bcc:
     Used to specify recipients in the 'cc' or 'bcc' fields.
     Example. cc:david
     Meaning. Messages that were cc-ed to David.
after:
before:
     Used to search for messages after or before a certain date (the
date must be in yyyy/mm/dd format). We generally recommend using the
'Show search options' link instead when specifying a date range to
search within, because it allows date input in a variety of formats.
     Example. after:2004/4/17 before:2004/4/18
     Meaning. Messages sent on April 17, 2004 (specifically, on or
after 2004/4/17 but strictly before 2004/4/18).
