           Summary: Toaster does not show new messages or popup when new
                    messages arrive
           Product: ZCS
           Version: 6.0.0_GunsNRoses
          Platform: NA
        OS/Version: Windows XP
            Status: NEW
          Severity: critical
          Priority: P2
         Component: Toaster
        AssignedTo: bugs_toaster@example.com
        ReportedBy: matt@example.com
                CC: fsiegel@example.com


Version: ZimbraToast-6.0.0_BETA2_1534-6.0.5562.0.msi

Looks like toaster is completely broken.  I point at df:

server: dogfood.zimbra.com
use ssl: yes
user: matt (or matt@example.com)
poll frequency: 1 min

Then, I receive lots of messages, but toaster never does anything.

I tried pointing at a test server, and same results.

Frank tried pointing at local host, and things seemed to work in that
configuration.
