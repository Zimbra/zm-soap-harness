SETI@example.com needs your help. The SETI@example.com team has accomplished much in the
past 6 months. We have successfully deployed the "enhanced" version of
SETI@example.com. The new seven beam data recorder has been installed at Arecibo (the
world's largest radio telescope) and is recording the data that will be
analyzed in the next phase of SETI@example.com.

But there is still far more to be done. We would like to be able to sift
through the results returned by your computers in order to identify candidates
more rapidly so we can re-observe them. This rapid response validation system
would also give you the ability to see the results your computers have/has
returned in more detail.
