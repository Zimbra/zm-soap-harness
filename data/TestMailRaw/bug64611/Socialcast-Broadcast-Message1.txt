The following Broadcast Message has been sent on behalf of Mark Egan:

"To All Employees,

As you know, we had an email outage situation last week that occurred as th=
e result of a storage issue with our EMC gear.  Both Exchange and Zimbra we=
re affected, and this had a serious impact on our customers, partners and e=
mployees.  There are several things I would like to communicate to the VMwa=
re community at this time:

1.       This was a highly unusual occurrence for this type of hardware fai=
lure.  We are working with EMC to replace the affected parts and will ship =
the old parts to EMC for diagnosis. It is a very high priority for EMC to d=
etermine the root cause of the failure.

2.       We have some work to do internally.  In addition to a complete pos=
t-mortem and failback planning, we are conducting a detailed review of our =
storage environment to identify any areas of improvement.  We are also goin=
g to closely coordinate the activities of the Business Continuity (BCP)/Dis=
aster Recovery (DR) Program with our Emergency Management Team (EMT) to ens=
ure we provide better coordination and communications in these situations i=
n the future.

3.       We have been working diligently to roll out our BCP and DR Program=
s. The decision was made to roll this out in two phases. Phase 1, occurring=
 earlier this year, was our data center move from our OSDC lab to our high-=
availability data center (SC9).  Because we had upgraded the network betwee=
n our three datacenters, we had connectivity between locations that enabled=
 us to get the email system recovered. Phase 2, scheduled for FY12, will pr=
ovide BCP/DR plans between SC9 and Wenatchee for OTC and GSS support.  A pl=
an is in place, and we will continue to roll this out according to our appr=
oved schedule.

My team is hard at work on this issue, and I will keep the company updated =
as to next steps and progress in this area. Thank you for your patience as =
we work our way through the process.

Mark" - Mark Egan
