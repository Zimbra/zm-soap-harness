To quote from my last mail -

(3) I'd like to have us use Patrick's contributed JAM code to help us get
going on the start-from-java compilation path, but then we need to make it
possible for Patrick to maintain that code and contribute other things on
the start-from-java scenario.

I propose we add Patrick as a committer.

I think the Apache procedure is that basically Patrick needs to have a CLA
and that we have to have a vote among the existing committers.  I think he
said that he faxed in a CLA when he sent his initial JAM code.

My vote is:

+1, because I want to start doing some start-from-java
compilation work asap, and want to make it easy for Patrick to continue
to help.

David
