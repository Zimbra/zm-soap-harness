Lawrence,

Ccing xmlbeans-dev.  The code there has been rewritten a couple times - it
used to operate on byte[] rather than char[]s, but then was changed when
EBCDIC support was added.

The firstIndexOfAscii function can simply be renamed firstIndexOf, and it
can do a straightforward character-comparison.  The whole try/catch/if
thing, with lookForBytes, etc can be entirely deleted.

I appreciate you looking at this stuff Lawrence; string.getBytes() is evil
for I18N - thanks for expunging it.

David

Hi Dave

I'm trying to replace all of the calls to getBytes() - so we can get this
over with. The one I'm not quite sure about is SniffedXmlInputStream in the
firstIndexOfAscii() method. I'm attaching a copy of an updated method below.

If the purpose were just to search part of the buf[] char array for the
String s then it seems like there would be much easier ways of doing it - so
I think the author must have deliberately meant the comparison of char to
byte that was previously in there.

Also the getBytes() that was originally there will get the bytes according
to the default char encoding - not always ASCII as I think was intended.

So anyway I've re-written it to do what I think the user intended - I've
used the fact that the UTF-8 encoding of any ASCII char is 1 byte. (If you
just say getBytes("ASCII") then you may well end up with a number of '?'s in
the bytes for chars it can't understand - so that doesn't work).

Could you just quickly check it over to make sure I'm doing what was wanted?

Cheers,
