Hello Irfan,

Thanks for your reply.

We have additional questions.

1.Does "zimbraSSLExcludeCipherSuites" reflect in ZimbraProxy(nginx)?
2.Is ZimbraProxy(nginx) able to block weak cipher.test.ccnnection between browser and ZimbraProxy by "zimbraSSLExcludeCipherSuites"?
3.Are Other secure sockets ("SMTPS", "IMAPS", "POPS") on ZimbraProxy able to block weak cipher?

Regards

> If weak ciphers are being accepted on ZCS server and your require them to block, you can use "zimbraSSLExcludeCipherSuites" attribute in ZCS. "zimbraSSLExcludeCipherSuites" is available in ZCS since 5.0.5. By-default "zimbraSSLExcludeCipherSuites".test.ccntains a list of default weak ciphers (lower than 128 bit), which are blocked. You can add more ciphers to the list to get better SSL security. Please check following wiki for more details about "zimbraSSLExcludeCipherSuites".
