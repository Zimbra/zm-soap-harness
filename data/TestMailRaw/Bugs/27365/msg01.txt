"The Global University: A Regional Focus" <br>
Portsmouth, New Hampshire<br>
July 14-16, 2008<br>
<br><br>
The primary focus for the summer meeting will be the ways in which
Universities currently partner with or could envision partnering with
institutions in Africa and China. Other regions and countries will also be
incorporated into some of the trans-global sessions.  The sessions will
provide insight into the needs of institutions in Africa and China, as well
as the needs of U.S. institutions for programming and relationships in these
countries.  Some examples around which sessions are being developed include
human and technical capacity building programs, successful joint research
projects, service learning and internship programs, and overcoming legal and
other barriers to expanding research or study abroad relationships.
