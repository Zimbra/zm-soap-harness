Theramenes was an Athenian statesman, prominent in the final decade of the =
Peloponnesian War. He was particularly active during the two periods of oli=
garchic government at Athens, as well as in the trial of the generals who h=
ad commanded at Arginusae in 406 BC. A moderate oligarch, he often found hi=
mself caught between the democrats on the one hand and the extreme oligarch=
s on the other. Successful in replacing a narrow oligarchy with a broader o=
ne in 411 BC, he failed to achieve the same end in 404 BC, and was executed=
 by the extremists whose policies he had opposed. Theramenes remained a con=
troversial figure after his death; Lysias vigorously denounced him while pr=
osecuting several of his former political allies, but others defended his a=
ctions. Modern historical assessments have shifted over time; in the 19th c=
entury, Theramenes was almost universally condemned, but recent scholarship=
 has produced more positive assessments. Some historians have found in Ther=
amenes a selfish opportunist, others a principled moderate. The details of =
his actions, his motivations, and the nature of his character continue to b=
e debated down to the present day.
