I have updated the runsoap.sh script so that it can be used generically on any system.

The usage is:

runsoap.sh <liquid dir> <LiquidQA dir> [ <qaweb dir> ]

<liquid dir> is the liquid install dir, i.e. /opt/liquid
<LiquidQA dir> is the basedir of the QA files, i.e. /home/amit/depot/main/LiquidQA
<qaweb dir>, which is optional, points to the QA web page directory (this setting doesn't apply to the PSPL systems.
