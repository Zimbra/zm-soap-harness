Cool!  Here are a couple possible ideas that might be a good first projectand helpful to users.

(1) A number of people have asked for more useful information from the XMLschema validator.  For example, "great that some element is missing here -but which element?"  And "I don't want to strip the QName of the offendingattribute from the text of the message, I want XmlError to have it."  Thiswould be a good project, and I know there are some users who would thank youvery much. And depending on how involved you want to get, it could be analgorithmically interesting project as well.

(2) Also, a common request is "why doesn't v1 support more of XPath?"  Well,cezar has done some good v2 work for using Jaxen for XPath, but this workhasn't been ported into v1.  Perhaps you might want to see what it wouldtake (I'm sure Cezar would help) to make v1 support Jaxen for XPath too.

Or... Do you have a specific area of interest?

Typically I would try andlook at bugzilla and go from there. The website listed the V2 Feature plan(http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?XmlBeansFeaturePlan).
