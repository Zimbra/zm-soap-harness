Error 16 says:-->No Path To EndpointThis indicates that STAFProc was not able to submit the request to therequested endpoint (i.e. machine). This error usually indicates that STAF isnot running on the target machine, or that the requested endpoint is notvalid, or that the network interface or port for the requested endpoint isnot supported. Alternatively, you may need to increase your CONNECTTIMEOUTvalue for the network interface and/or increase your CONNECTATTEMPTS valuein your STAF.cfg file.
