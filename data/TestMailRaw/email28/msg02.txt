I added some more logging to the test case, and then ran against FC5.More logging includes logging the global settings and "in:inbox" and"in:junk" searches.  The results(http://qa00/testlogs/FC5/FRANK/20070109020101_FOSS/soap/smoke/1168381665/qa21/) confirmed that the message is being routed to SPAM.
