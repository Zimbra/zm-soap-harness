We think that because the same sender address (foo@example.com) is beingused, that the spam scores for the smtp server are being increased by thezimbra server.  Therefore, all SMTP messages from the same address arebeing marked as spam - meaning all messages being sent by the SMTP clientis treated as spam.  I am not sure why only SUSE10, FC4, FC5, and RHEL4_64are being affected.
