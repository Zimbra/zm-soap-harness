  The Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the 
foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups: 
Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Here you will find information 
on these important patterns.

To give you a head start, the C# source code is provided in 2 forms: 
'structural' and 'real-world'. Structural code uses type names as 
defined in the pattern definition and UML diagrams. Real-world code 
provides real-world programming situations where you may use these 
patterns.
